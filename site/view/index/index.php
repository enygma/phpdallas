			DallasPHP is the premier PHP Developer's Group for North Texas. We meet for a presentation at <a href="http://bit.ly/gSU5fF">SoftLayer Offices</a> in Addison on the second Tuesday of each month.
			</p>
			<p> 
			There is a secondary meeting held each month on the following saturday, where members discuss any PHP topic raised and answer any questions asked. There are no dues or membership fees. Our membership is primarily made up of professional PHP developers, however, PHP users of all skill levels are welcome at all meetings.
